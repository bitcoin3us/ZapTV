# Payment class — one entry in the on-screen transaction list.
#
# Amounts are always stored as signed integer satoshis (negative = outgoing /
# fee-only self-transfer); the unit shown to the user is always sats too,
# regardless of whether the balance label is set to bits / micro-BTC / etc.
# The only display variation is whether to use the "₿" prefix vs the "sats"
# suffix (`use_symbol` toggle), and the thousands separator follows the
# MicroPythonOS NumberFormat preference (US "1,234", EU "1.234", etc.) so
# transaction amounts match the balance label's separator style.
